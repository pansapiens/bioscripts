A collection of biomolecular sequence and structure analysis scripts I've written for various bioinformatics projects over the years.

* memsat3 -- a wrapper script for the MEMSAT3 transmembrane region predictor
* clans -- contains clans2svg, a script for converting CLANS ( http://bioinfoserver.rsbs.anu.edu.au/programs/clans/ ) layouts to SVG for higher quality publication figures.
