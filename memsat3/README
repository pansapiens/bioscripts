# This script runs MEMSAT3 (http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/software_downloads/memsat/) 
# over a FASTA format database of sequences.
# It outputs a series of fasta-like files (one for each sequence) into
# a directory 'memsat_out', containing the predicted transmembrane 
# regions and topology. Also outputs a summary of sequence ids and 
# number of transmembranes to stderr (either as CSV or a TMHMM-like 
# output). Can optionally choose to not output proteins predicted 
# to be cytosolic proteins.

# This script was used in the analysis for the publication:
#  "Jedelský PL, Doležal P, Rada P, Pyrih J, Šmíd O, et al. (2011) 
#   The Minimal Proteome in the Reduced Mitochondrion of the Parasitic 
#   Protist Giardia intestinalis. PLoS ONE 6: e17285."
#   ( http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017285 )

#
## Dependancies:
#   * MEMSAT3 (http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/software_downloads/memsat/)
#     (MEMSAT3 requires PSIBLAST and an installed BLAST database
#      [default is 'swiss'] for decent performance.
#      Tip: read & edit the 'runmemsat' script. It uses tcsh.)
#   * Biopython (http://biopython.org, for Bio.SeqIO.FASTA).
#       Tip: tested with version 1.57
#
## Installation:
#  You should change the memsat_bin variable below to point to
#  the 'runmemsat' script in your MEMSAT3 installation.
#  Also set the outdir, emulate_tmhmm_output and 
#  include_cytosolic variables as desired.
#
## Run like:
#   $ ./memsat3.py test.fasta 2>test_results.tsv
